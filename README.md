  * Tech
    * RabbitMQ
      * AMQP: advanced message queuing protocol - for message data format
      * Can be set up in a cluster for high available systems
      * Architecture
      * Install: https://www.rabbitmq.com/install-homebrew.html
      * Error:
        * "Can't set short node name!\n Please check your configuration\n"

        $ sudo scutil --set YourHostName
        $ sudo vim /etc/hosts, change "127.0.0.1 localhost YourHostName"
        ```
      * Commands:
        ```
        start: $ rabbitmq-server start
        $ rabbitmqctl status
        $ rabbitmqctl list_queues
        $ rabbitmqctl cluster_status
        $ rabbitmq-plugins list (for other message brokers)
        $ rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_management (http://localhost:15672/, use guest/guest to login)
        $ rabbitmq-plugins disable rabbitmq_management
        ```
      * Golang support
        https://godoc.org/github.com/streadway/amqp, rabbitmq client with AMQP protocol
        Install: $ go get -u github.com/streadway/amqp
    * Postgres
      * communicate with golang: https://github.com/lib/pq
      * listening port: 5432
      * pdAdmin for UI managements
    * Web client: http://localhost:3000/public/
      * use RabbitMQ to push data from coordinator to web application
      * use web socket to communicate between web application and browser
      * UI: canvasjs.com
  * Flow
    * Sensors keep publishing reading data to message queues
    * Consumers keep consuming messages and generate events (This event pattern allows data sources and consumers to be decoupled from each other in a highly concurrent system)
    * Coordinator is between data consumers and data sources (sensors), including all the business logic about how to handle messages
    ```
    $ go run src/powerplant/coordinator/executor/main.go (consuming messages)

    $ go run src/powerplant/sensors/executor/main.go (publishing messages)
    $ go run src/powerplant/sensors/executor/main.go -name=boiler_pressure_out -min=15 -max=15.5 -step=0.05 -freq=1

    $ go run src/powerplant/datamanager/executor/main.go (persist data to the database)
    ```
